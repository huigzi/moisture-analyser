/**
 *  \brief  OV7960 Ioctl commands
 * Following IOCTL commands will be used to perform control operation on OV7960
 * device. These are the generic EDC IOCTLS are supported
 *
 * Edc_IOCTL_CONFIG  - Argument is a pointer to OV7960_ConfParams structure
 * Edc_IOCTL_RESET   - Doesn't take any argument
 * Edc_IOCTL_SET_REG - Argument is a pointer to Edc_RegData structure. This
 *                     IOCTL is supported with restriction that only one
 *                     register can be written to the OV7960 device also note
 *                     the way register values should be passed. For example:
 *     Edc_RegData regval;
 *     Uint8 val[2];
 *     regval.startReg = 0x07u;
 *     regval.noRegToRW = 1u;
 *     val[0] = 0x00; NOTE: MSB value of register
 *     val[1] = 0x42; NOTE: LSB value of register
 *     regval.value = (&val);
 * Edc_IOCTL_GET_REG - This IOCTL is not suported by OV7960 device as some
 *                     registers when the driver tries to read back and verify,
 *                     it will give errors.
